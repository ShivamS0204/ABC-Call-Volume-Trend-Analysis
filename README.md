📞 ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis:
This project analyses 23 days of inbound call data from a customer service centre to uncover actionable insights for improving customer experience, agent performance, and manpower planning.


📌 Project Overview:
We explore call volume trends, call duration patterns, and customer interaction outcomes to optimise staffing and service quality. The dataset includes:
* Agent information (ID, Name)
* Queue time
* Call timing & duration
* Call status (answered, abandoned, transferred)


🚀 Approach:
* Data Extraction: The Dataset was imported into Microsoft Excel.
* Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant entries, handled missing values, and formatted data.
* Data Analysis: Used pivot tables, charts, and formulas for detailed trend analysis.


🛠️ Tech Stack:
* Microsoft Excel 2019 – Data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation
* Microsoft PowerPoint 2019 – Presentation of findings
* Google Drive – Storage and sharing


📊 Key Analytical Tasks: 
* Call Duration Analysis: Identified time buckets with the highest and lowest average call durations.
* Call Volume Visualisation: Mapped call frequency by hour to reveal peak and off-peak periods.
* Manpower Planning (Day & Night Shift): Determined optimal agent headcount per hour to meet a <10% abandon rate.


📈 Insights & Findings: 
* Peak Call Duration: 10–11 AM and 7–8 PM (~203 sec)
* Lowest Duration: 12–1 PM (~193 sec)
* Highest Call Volume: 11–12 PM (14,626 calls)
* Current Abandon Rate: 29.1%
* Manpower Recommendation:
      Day: Min. 54 agents to reduce the abandonment rate to 10%
      Night: ~17 agents needed across 12 hours (9 PM – 9 AM)


✅ Conclusion: 
* Aligning staffing with call volume patterns improves service quality.
* The busiest period (10 AM–1 PM) needs the highest agent coverage.
* Off-peak and night shifts can operate with lean staffing.
